Computer Science 498 - Grid Software Engineering.

1) This Project is designed to deliver a Hybrid Cloud Software Manager which will manage, Datacenters, Virtual Machines, and Infrastructure creating a grid.
2) The Grid will contain An Application which manages nodes on the grid as a minimum, and a controller for each node.
3) A Node is roughly equivalent to a Hosting Account.
4) The System Has A Graphical Interface, a Controller, and Either a Database or a Flat File Architecture or Both.
5) The Grid Should have additional applications which run on the Infrastructure and each have a Database Instance, But not necessary its own DBMS.
6) This system should save 10's of Thousands of DBMS instances which is both a massive savings, but an equivalent risk.
7) The risks are offset by Virtual Machine snapshots, log shipping, flat files and active active DBMS replication in some combination as discussed in the product plan.
8) Assumptions for a mix of clients should be assumed.
